1) Check whether given string is Anagram
2) Count the occurence of anagram is string
3) print all permutation of string
4) Non Repeating Character
5) Second most Repeating Character in string
6) Remove common characters between two string and concatinate two strins
7) Longest Distinct characters in string
8) Smallest window in a string containing all the characters of another string
9) Smallest distinct window
   Given a string 's'. The task is to find the smallest window length that 
   contains all the characters of the given string at least one time.
   For eg. A = aabcbcdbca, then the result would be 4 as of the smallest 
   window will be dbca.
10) Length of longest substring in a string
    Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring without
    repeating characters.
11) Print Anagrams Together
12) Given a pattern containing only I's and D's. 
    I for increasing and D for decreasing.
    Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number 
    following that pattern.
    Digits from 1-9 and digits can't repeat.

        Input:
        D
        Output:
        21
        Explanation:
        D is meant for decreasing,
        So we choose the minimum number
        among 21,31,54,87,etc.
