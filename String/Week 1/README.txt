1) reverse the individual words
2) Check whether given string is palindrome
3) Convert number to string (some test cases not pass)
4) Minimize string value Given a string of lowercase 
   alphabets and a number k, the task is to find the minimum 
   value of the string after removal of ‘k’ characters. 
   The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of 
   the count of each distinct character.
   For example consider the string “geeks”, here frequencies of 
   characters are g -> 1, e -> 2, k -> 1, s -> 1 and value of the 
   string is 12 + 22 + 12 + 12 = 7
5) Check if string is rotated by two places 
6) Run Length Encoding
    Given a string, Your task is to  complete the function encode 
    that returns the run length encoded string for the given string.
    eg if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function 
    should return “w4a3d1e1x6″.
    You are required to complete the function encode that takes only 
    one argument the string which is to be encoded and returns the
    encoded string.
7) Pattern searching
8) Merger two strings
9) Strint comparition(problem statement is not clear )
10) Find k-th character in string
11) Count Substrings 
    Given a binary string S. The task is to count the number of substrings
    that starts and end with 1.
12) Remove all duplicates from a given string 
13) Reverse each word in a given string
14) Min Manipulations to make Strings Anagram
